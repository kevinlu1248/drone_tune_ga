# Google Assistant Drone Tuner 
"Hey Google, talk to Drone Tuner about concert A natural"
Open source sine wave oscillations .wav files can be found at https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/actions-codelab-70db8.appspot.com/o/audiocheck.net_sin_440.00Hz_-3dBFS_10s.wav?alt=media and just change the 440.00 to the frequency you need.

## Functions yet to implement:
- Switch octaves 
  - This isn't too hard except Google's documentation is hard to follow
- Play a note and get Google to tell you how in tune you are (or lack thereof)
  - This isn't possible until Google allows us to access user's audio files
